This is my first WWDC. It's a long week with little surprise and lots
of learning.

The overall quality and quantity of the sessions are well designed
and presented. However, the best talks delighting my whole
experience at WWDC are from [lunchtime speakers][lunchtime-speakers].

"Think Audacious" given by Debbie Sterling at Wednesday lunchtime is
about her amazing entrepreneurial journey with
[GoldieBlox][goldieblox]. Her story showed me how
amazing and powerful it could be when you truly committed yourself to
a dream that is bigger than yourself. It blows my mind that the ideas
coming from great purpose have such natural power. I wish all the best
to Debbie Sterling and her [GoldieBlox][goldieblox]. The
[GoldieBlox][goldieblox]'s toys is certainly in my shopping list for
my daughter.

"How to Discover a Planet: An Evolution of Search and Discovery" by
Mike Brown is another inspiring talk.
I heard about Pluto was not a planet anymore, but I didn't realize
there was so interesting story about why Pluto is not a planet. In
this talk, Mike went through history of searching and discovering
planets in our solar system and revealed how close we're at
reaching the new 9th planet. The future of searching and discovering
new planets will use massive data sets from giant telescopes.
[LSST][lsst], Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, will make the
full resolution, full depth image data available to download
for everyone in the world when it starts operating.

I wish I could find videos of these talks, because I missed
Thursday one "Making Magic: Creative Imagination Meets Technological
Innovation" by Floyd Norman.

Among all of other talks, I like the design related topics. The best
one is [Designing for Future Hardware][designing-for-future-hardware],
which follows the theme of last year's
[Prototyping:Fake It Till You Make It][prototyping]. The first time I
learned prototyping techniques is reading book
[Don't Make Me Think][dmmt]. Later I observed [Luke Barrett][luke]
used these techniques in the user interviews for early feedback of
designing [Mingle][mingle] user interface. Apple's designers have really
pushed the boundaries of prototyping for design. The "make - show -
learn" loop seems a simple concept and easy to learn, and the well
designed talk with a fun example really helps you to use these
techniques in your product design.

The biggest surprise to me on this WWDC is coming from Apple will
enable native Watch app by upgrading watchOS.
I thought Apple Watch app is just an extension of iPhone, at least for
the first generation. However, we probably can expect to see more of
these kind of improving, because Tesla is going to deliver their
auto-steering feature by software upgrading.
Although native Watch app is coming, I still think Watch app is an
extension of iPhone app. In other words, Watch app can be huge user
experience improvement of your iPhone app.
As "Designing for Apple Watch" mentioned:

1. Personal Communication
2. Holistic Design
3. Lightweight Interaction

Watch app lives in a totally different environment which has huge
constrains and advantages comparing with iPhone app.
I'm also amazed of how well Apple prepared for educating and
helping future Watch app development:

1. The whole design section sessions are either about Watch app design
   or related to Watch app design. There are more than 11 sessions
   (just counting sessions have "Watch" in its name) talking about
   every aspect of Watch app development.
2. New system font "San Francisco" is designed for Watch, which
   removes fundamental block of designing on small screen.
3. Handoff feature connects all of iOS devices. This is truly powerful
   feature for Watch app, which enables developers follow Apple's
   design principles and clears blocks of building less on Watch app.
